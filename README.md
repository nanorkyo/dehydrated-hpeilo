# dehydrated-hpeilo
This is a dehydrated helper plugin for HPE iLO(Integrated Lights-Out).

To sign a CSR generated by HPE iLO and import a certificate signed by Let's Encrypt into it, do following things:
- Install hpeilo.sh to `${CONFIG_D}` directory, and set CONFIG_D on `/usr/local/etc/dehydrated/config`.
- Set `OPENSSL=hpeilo_openssl` on `/usr/local/etc/dehydrated/config` or per-domain directory.  In this time, my plugin doesn't work.  Please read following.
  - If you use latest version, please apply my [patch](https://github.com/nanorkyo/dehydrated/commit/a7786de5f86a3c2eee3daec563216c97c407cf2e).
  - If you use v0.4.0 and/or before, please apply my [patch](https://github.com/nanorkyo/dehydrated/commit/e42667b7e29e15b0342817fa07b8d4d187cac8fd).
- Add reading a helper plugin to `hook.sh`, and use it's functions.
- Set HPE iLO custom settings on per-domain directory like `/usr/local/etc/dehydrated/certs/DOMAIN/hpeilo_config`.

NOTE: I tested only dns-01 challenge type, so I don't know what will happen with http-01 challenge type.

## hook.sh
```text
  :
. path/to/hpeilo.sh
  :
function deploy_cert {
    local DOMAIN="${1}" KEYFILE="${2}" CERTFILE="${3}" FULLCHAINFILE="${4}" CHAINFILE="${5}" TIMESTAMP="${6}"

    case "${OPENSSL}" in
      "hpeilo_openssl")
        hpeilo_ImportCertificate "${DOMAIN}" "${CERTFILE}" "${CHAINFILE}"
        ;;
      *)
        echo " ! No deploy certificate."
        ;;
    esac
}
  :
```

## hpeilo_config in per-domain directory
Put following file in `/usr/local/etc/dehydrated/certs/DOMAIN/hpeilo_config`.

```text
HPEILO_AUTHKEY="IDandPasswordEncodedByBase64"
HPEILO_C="JP"
HPEILO_ST="Tokyo"
HPEILO_L="Chiyoda"
HPEILO_O="Example Japan"
HPEILO_OU="System Department"
```

To get HPEILO_AUTHKEY's value, run `echo -n iLO-ID:iLO-PASSWORD | openssl base64 -e`.  And do `chmod 0600 hpeilo_config`.

## Example
```text
dehydrated -c -d ilojptXXXXXXX.example.jp
```

## Tested and Supported iLOs
- iLO2/iLO3 not supported.
- iLO4 2.53 and/or after.
  - 2.50 and/or before: SANs have a extra `IP:` address, so miss signing a CSR by dehydrated(and Let's Encrypt).
  - 2.53: cannot import a intermidiate certificate.  So I reported this issue to HPE iLO development team.
  - 2.54: cannot import a intermidiate certificate.
- iLO5 not confirmed(maybe 1.10 and/or after).
